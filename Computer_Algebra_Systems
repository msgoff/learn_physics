The following is a collection of synonyms for various operations in
the computer algebra systems [Axiom], [Derive], [GAP], [Gmp], DoCon,
[Macsyma], [Magnus], [Maxima], [Maple], [Mathematica], [MuPAD], [Octave],
[Pari], [Reduce], [Scilab], [Sumit] and [Yacas]. This collection does not
attempt to be comprehensive, but hopefully it will be useful in giving
an indication of how to translate between the syntaxes used by the
different systems in many common situations. Note that a blank entry
means either (a) that there may be an exact translation of a
particular operation for the indicated system, but we don't know what
it is or (b) there is no exact translation but it may still be
possible to work around this lack with a related functionality.
